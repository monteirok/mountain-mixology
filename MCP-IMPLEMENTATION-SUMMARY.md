### Lead Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
Base Score = 0
+ Budget scoring: $10K+ (50pts), $5-10K (30pts), $2.5-5K (20pts)

+ Guest count: 100+ (20pts), 50+ (15pts), 25+ (10pts)

Quality Levels:
- High: 70+ points (immediate deal creation)
- Medium: 40-69 points (standard follow-up)
- Low: <40 points (basic nurture sequence)
```
