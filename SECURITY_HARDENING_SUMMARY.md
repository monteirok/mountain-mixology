## Risk Reduction Analysis

### Before Hardening
| Risk Category | Level | Issues |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| Authentication | High | Hardcoded passwords, no validation |
| XSS Attacks | High | No CSP, missing security headers |
| Dependency Vulns | Medium | No monitoring, outdated packages |
| Data Exposure | Medium | No input validation |
| Code Quality | Medium | Loose TypeScript, no standards |

### After Hardening
| Risk Category | Level | Mitigation |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| Authentication | Low | Secure bootstrap, validated env vars |
| XSS Attacks | Low | Comprehensive CSP, security headers |
| Dependency Vulns | Low | Automated monitoring, update policy |
| Data Exposure | Low | Input validation, type safety |
| Code Quality | Low | Strict TypeScript, ESLint rules |
